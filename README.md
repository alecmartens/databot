# databot
Discord Bot (Databot)\
The project that I worked on was coding a Discord bot. This bot was coded in Visual Studio Code, and it uses Node JS and Discord JS. It is also connected to a MySQL database.\
Features:\
#flip: Flips a coin and adds the record (heads or tails) into the SQL database.\
#roll: Rolls a die and add the record (1-6) into the SQL database.\
#8ball <question>: Ask the 8ball a question and get a response from a SQL database populated with magic 8 ball answers.\
#covid <country name>: Get coronavirus information for a specific country or global from an online database (disease.sh)\
#joke (yomama, chuck): Tells a random Yo Momma or Chuck Norris joke from an online database (https://api.yomomma.info/, https://api.chucknorris.io)\
#name (boy, girl, all): Gets a random name from an online database (http://names.drycodes.com)\
#exp: Tells user how much XP points they have and what level they are. Every time a user types in the channel, they will gain XP. The users ID and XP amount is updated automatically in an SQL database.
